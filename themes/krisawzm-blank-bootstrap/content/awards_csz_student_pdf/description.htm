<h4>Description</h4><p>
	This award will assist students and post-doctoral fellows from Canadian universities with expenses incurred during collaborative visits to other laboratories, research facilities, field stations or sites to conduct zoological research. The intention is to support ancillary research activities that will supplement and enhance the applicant's core research program, and not to fund the core research itself which is the responsibility of the applicant's supervisor.
