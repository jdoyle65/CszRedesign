<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The Parasitism, Immunity and Environment (PIE) Section of the Canadian Society of Zoologists (CSZ) promotes study of the interrelationships at all levels among infectious agents, the response of animals to these agents, and the environment in which these relationships exist.  The Wardle Award normally will be awarded annually for outstanding contributions to Canadian-based research on the fields of study promoted by the PIE Section. <br>
</p>
<p>“Canadian-based research” is understood to be research done by a Canadian, and/or research conducted in Canada.<br>
</p>
<p>"Outstanding contribution" is understood normally to have been one that has had significant cumulative impact on the field over an extended period. However, it may be interpreted as a single highly meritorious breakthrough.
