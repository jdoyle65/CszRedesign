<h4>Terms of reference</h4><h5>Objectives</h5><p>The Award is given for the best student paper presented orally at the Annual Conference of the Society, and is intended to encourage and acknowledge excellence in scientific research and communication by students.
</p><h5>Award</h5><p>Cash prize (currently $500) and a scroll.
</p><h5>Source of Prize</h5><p>Funded through the Zoology Education Trust (ZET).
</p><h5>Frequency of Availability</h5><p>One per year. The Society reserves the right not to make this award if either the quantity or quality of applications is deemed insufficient.
</p><h5>Application Procedures</h5><ol><li><span>Candidates must send to the First Vice-President an electronic file of a summary of the oral presentation before the application deadline (see next section). When registering for the Annual Conference, potential candidates normally also indicate their intention to participate in the competition.</span><br></li><li><span>Papers in the competition may have multiple authors; however the competing student must be the first author. In the case of multiple authors, the student's supervisor must also submit a letter describing briefly how the research is primarily that of the competing student, and summarizing the contribution of each author.</span><br></li><li><span>The summary must not exceed 1000 words (including title and authors, but not references) and should include the objectives of the study, a brief description of the materials and methods, the results, conclusions and scientific relevance. The primary purposes of the summary are to place the contribution within the perspective of the discipline and for prescreening when the number of applicants exceeds the capacity of the judging committee. Therefore, it is normally inappropriate to devote excessive space to materials and methods. It is, however, appropriate to cite pertinent references.</span><br></li><li><span>Along with this summary the student must submit to the First Vice-President the abstract that is forwarded in response to the call for papers issued by the organizers of the Annual Conference.</span><br></li></ol><h5>Application Deadline</h5><p>Established by the Committee of Judges, normally chaired by the First Vice-President and consisting of members from the four disciplinary sections of the CSZ. At the time of registration students normally indicate their intention of entering this competition. Normally the summary is due to the First Vice-President at or about the time of the abstract submission deadline for the Annual Conference. Students should consult the Annual Conference web site for further details.
</p><h5>Selection Procedures</h5><p>From the summaries submitted, the Committee of Judges will select approximately 7 final contestants. The Committee encourages participation from all zoological disciplines but submissions will be judged solely on the basis of scientific merit. The authors of the selected summaries will present their papers at the Annual Conference. The Committee of Judges will select the William S. Hoar Award recipient by consensus on the basis of oral presentation and its scientific content. Summaries that are not selected as final contestants will be scheduled in regular sessions of the Annual Conference without mention of their participation in the William S. Hoar Award Competition.
</p><h5>Other Conditions</h5><p>These regulations shall be public and available to all competitors. A student may compete only once for either the Hoar Award or the Best Student Poster Award at each Annual Conference. A student who has won the Hoar Award is no longer eligible for the competition.
