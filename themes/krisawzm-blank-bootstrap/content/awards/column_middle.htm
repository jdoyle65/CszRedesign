<h2>Recognition of excellence in research</h2>
<p>The Canadian Society of Zoologists recognizes excellence in research. Many prizes and awards are given every year funded by the Zoological Education Trust (ZET), the sections, members of the Society and CSZ. We encourage student participation at the annual meeting by many prizes for the best oral and poster presentations.
