<p>The Ecology, Ethology and Evolution (EEE) section includes researchers studying animal ecology, ethology, and evolution and those studying intersecting sets of these three fields including: behavioural ecology/evolution, biodiversity, conservation biology, evolutionary ecology, landscape genomics, systematics, and wildlife biology. Many interdisciplinary EEE members also belong to other CSZ sections including Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry (CPB: physiological ecology/ecological physiology; hormonal and neural regulation of behaviour), Parasitism, Immunity and Environment (PIE: molecular systematics or ecological role of parasites) and Comparative Morphology and Development (CMD: interface between traditional morphological systematics and modern molecular systematics/barcoding).
</p>
<p>Within CSZ, EEE promotes the cross-fertilization of ideas and knowledge both within disciplines and across disciplines through the wide range of research within the Section and through the annual conference where all four sections (EEE, CPB, PIE, and CMD ) convene simultaneously and present separate or joint symposia.
