<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This Award recognizes members of the CSZ who have contributed enormously to the well being of zoology in Canada by working hard for the CSZ, often well beyond the call of duty, but in ways that are not currently recognized by other Society awards.
</p>
<p>Over the years of the Society's existence, many members have contributed enormously to the well being of Zoology in Canada by working hard for the Canadian Society of Zoologists, often well beyond the call of duty.
</p>
<p>For those who have made significant contributions as researchers, or in public education, there are ways in which they are currently recognized by the Society.
</p>
<p>Nowhere at present, however, do we recognize in a formal way the significant contributions that are made by some of our officers, councilors, or members.
</p>
<p>This award seeks to remedy this situation, and will be made only when a deserving candidate is identified.
